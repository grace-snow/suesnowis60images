# Sue Snow is 60 - Image Gallery

A single page photo site using CSS grid and javascript to populate a photo gallery at random.

This was set up to celebrate my mum's 60th birthday and let her see full-sized versions of the images used on issuesnow60.com(http://issuesnow60.com).

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repo.
2. Delete all existing images _(these are copyright protected and not to be used without prior permission)_
3. Put your own photos in the `images` folder, renamed to simple numbers _e.g. 1.jpg_
4. run ```browser-sync start --server --files '**/*.css, **/*.html, **/*.js, !node_modules/**/*'
--directory --port 7777``` to live preview as you make changes
